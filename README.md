# Multithreaded file signature

Here is the code for creating a file signature using multithreading.

It is required to write utilite with C++ for generating of file signature.

Signature will be generating as follows: origin file should be divided into equal parts.
If the size of a file is not equally divided on size of a block, the last size can be less or can be added by zeros.
For each block is calculating the value of a hash function and adding to output file.

Interface:
 - Path to input file;
 - Path to output file;
 - The size of a block, by default 1 MB

The file should be optimized with multithreading
 - The correct processing of all errors based on exceptions should be provided.
 - For resources should be used smart ptrs;
 - It is forbidden to use additional libraries;
 - The utilite should correctly work for Linux, x86 and x64

File is divided into equal parts. 
The chunk is read by the Thread produceData;
The hash function is calculating in Thread-pull tasks;
Tht results of calculating are collecting in the Thread resumeData.

# Possible improvments:
To consider other hash funciton;
To consider non-blocking thread-safe queue;
To simplify code;
To test with different implementaions;

For chunkSize = 1MB, the multi-threaded implementation was 2.5 times faster than the single-threaded one.
For chunkSize = 100MB multi-threaded implementation was 2.1 times faster than single-threaded.

# Explanation of results:

It turns out that my previous tests were done with the mutex commented out. With this mutex, the benchmarks are exactly the same as for the single-threaded version of the application. This mutex was the main reason for the stucking of the whole process.
Was it fixed?
Yes, it was... I hope. 
First, in the corrected version, I used a thread-safe queue with the simplest mutex data protection and simplified code. The results got a little better. Compared to the single-threaded version, twice as good.

Secondly...
The main idea was to avoid blocking the thread producing the data. I was sure that a thread-safe, free-locking queue would greatly speed up the implementation. But I was wrong. I got very similar results. My tests correlate really well with Amdahl's law. The maximum results for my laptop with 4 cores are about 2-2.7 times. Actually, I tried different variants of BOOST's queue, but on average the results were the same (speed up 2-2.7 times).

Thanks.
